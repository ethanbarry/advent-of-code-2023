# Advent of Code 2023

This is my set of Rust solutions to the problems. I'm making use of @chrisbiscardi's project
layout, with adaptations by a friend on the Fediverse. We'll see where this goes; I have finals, so
I may not be able to finish them all on time...

## PROGRESS

- [x] Day One
- [x] Day Two
- [ ] Day Three
- [ ] Day Four
- [ ] Day Five
- [ ] Day Six
- [ ] Day Seven
- [ ] Day Eight...

### About this:

- I'm completing it in Rust.
- My objective is to make it as "functional" as possible, using `map()` and `collect()`, &c.
- Most of all, I want to have fun with friends!
